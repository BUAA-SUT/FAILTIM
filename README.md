# Identifying the Failure-Revealing Test Cases in Metamorphic Testing: A Statistical Approach
## Experimental Data
The subject suites studied in our work are collected at here, which contains Siemens, Unix utilities, Space and Defects4J1,2,3,4. Each subject program has been packaged with several fault versions containing the spectrum of the passed and failed test cases and the location of faults. The details of these test suites are outlined in our paper titled "R-SBFL: Enhancing Robustness in Spectrum-Based Fault Localization." After downloading the .zip file, unzip it in a directory to save these test suites.
